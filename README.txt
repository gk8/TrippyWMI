Commenced work on project. Registered github account, decided on Scrum Agile software engineering model, with
focus on programming sprints and incremental progress to facilitate a working program within a week's time, and continued week-long sprints as necessary until software maturity is reached. Final deliverable shall be open sourced, freely available to anyone and everyone who may find use in the application. To that end, program code may be modified and used without contacting the author (me) for approval, unless said program or code within it is intended to be used for profit or in commercial applications. Said program or code contained may not be used in any way for profit without explicit permission from the author, German Kutsy.
